# Traffic_Ad-words-project
A complete data analysis and engineering project using MySQL, Power BI, and Python.
# SEO Traffic & Keyword Strategy Analysis 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes search traffic data to identify high-value keywords, optimize ad spend, and understand market competition. The goal was to build an end-to-end pipeline from raw Excel data to a live Power BI dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* **Excel:** Data cleaning and normalization.
* **MySQL:** Relational database design (Star Schema) and data storage.
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboarding, DAX measures, and Dual-Axis charts.
* **Python (K-Means):** Machine Learning for clustering keywords by Volume vs. Cost.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **Traffic vs Volume:** While "PMP" has 600k+ search volume, actual traffic is significantly lower, indicating a need for conversion optimization.
* **Cost Efficiency:** Identified "Low Cost / Low Competition" keywords (Cluster 2) that offer cheap traffic opportunities.
* **Ranking:** Tracking "Current vs Previous" position showed which keywords are losing SEO rank.
